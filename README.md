# Viper Client ðŸ‘· (WIP)
Thi is code for my doorbell; specifically for the Comelit Mini Wi-Fi MSFV. This features a ViperClient which can talk to the Comelit Mini Wi-fi MSFV directly; so without intermediary Cloud devices.

This code is quite experimental and not ready to be used for anything real.

## Setup:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill out the details in the `.env` file, to do a demo run, simply type:

```bash
cargo run
```

Eventually I'm planning to turn this into a library of sorts, but for now considering how experimental this is, I'm leaving it as such
